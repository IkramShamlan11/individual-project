                    First and foremost, this is a picture of my beloved parents. My father is 56 years old, 
                    and his name is Mohd Shamlan bin Mohd Tajuddin. My father has a fierce look but he is 
                    very pleasant when he meets new people and can be welcomed to chat for longer than anyone 
                    expected due to his welcoming attitude. Then, there's my one and only mother, Nizar binti 
                    Noordin. There are no words to express who she is. My mother is god's most precious gift 
                    to me, and she is my heaven. My mother is the source of my happiness in my life. Without 
                    my mother, there would be no Muhammad Ikram bin Mohd Shamlan in this entire world.
